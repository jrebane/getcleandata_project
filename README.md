# Contents of Repository

This repository includes four files:

- [`run_analysis.R`](https://github.com/jrebane/getcleandata_project/blob/master/run_analysis.R): Commented R script that sources and processes data to create a tidy data set according to the instructions outlined by Prof. Jeffrey Leek in the Coursera course, Getting and Cleaning Data
- [`CodeBook.md`](https://github.com/jrebane/getcleandata_project/blob/master/CodeBook.MD): Document which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the source data
- `README.md`: (This file) Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
- [`tidy_mean_data.txt`](https://github.com/jrebane/getcleandata_project/blob/master/tidy_mean_data.txt): Tidy data set generated by the `run_analysis.R` script and written to a text file using the `write.table()` function

# Details on Analysis Script:

The `run_analysis.R` script can be run in any directory (it downloads the data directly from the source in case it is not found in the directory). It performs analysis on said file and creates a tidy data set through the following steps:

> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Package Dependencies

The following packages are required for the proper function of the `run_analysis.R` script:
- `dplyr`
- `reshape2`
